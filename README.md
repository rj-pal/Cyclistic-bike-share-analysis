# Cyclistic-bike-share-analysis

My [final report](https://rj-pal.github.io/Cyclistic-bike-share-analysis/) for the Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The data analysis in this project is for the fictional Cyclistic Bike Sharing System (based on a real bike share system in Chicago) and takes aim to examine **the trends in use of the bikes system**,  **the difference between the two types of users**: *members* and *casual users*, and how **these trends and differences** can be **capitalized on to increase the sales of annual memberships**, i.e. *convert casual users to members*. A **complete explanation of the business task**, my **thinking process**, and the **approach I took to solve the task at hand** can be found in the Rmd file in this directory or viewed [here](https://rj-pal.github.io/Cyclistic-bike-share-analysis/). 

This project covers the complete data analysis process as explicated in the Coursera Google program: *Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share*, and *Act*. The report originally consisted of a series of *R-files*, but after the two analyses were *merged together*, much of the work was done in one *Rmd file*, which is included in the main directory. Since the completion of the project last year, I have *updated the directory organization of the project*, and have *proofread and edited the complete analysis*, which explains the data analysis process from start to finish. This [final report](https://rj-pal.github.io/Cyclistic-bike-share-analysis/) includes **R-scripts**, **charts**, **graphs and visualizations**, **explanations**, **reasoning**, and **demonstrative actions to be taken** to optimize user experience and increase the membership numbers of the bike system. Because of the large nature of the files, the *data file is not included* in this on-line repository.
